Once upon a time there lived a monkey on tree near the river in a forest. In the same forest lived a crocodile with his wife.
One day the crocodile came to banks of the river and rested under the tree. The kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits.Crocodile liked the fruits so he came again the next day. Days passed by and crocodile and monkey became good friends.
Just testing
